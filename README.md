# BeamNG_TechProof_Basic

This is a minimal proof-of-concept mod structure for BeamNG.tech, created by rdgfste (Iraq)  
It demonstrates understanding of Lua-JBeam integration and is intended to support a licensing request.

## Structure

- Lua controller: `techProof.lua`
- JBeam linkage: `techProof.jbeam`

## Purpose

This mod is designed to show readiness for scientific simulation using BeamNG.tech.  
It will be expanded into a full real-time physics control system once access is granted.
